# Work-Day-Planner

This app is made to be able to plan a work day and display the date at the top of the page.
The text areas next to each hour change color depending on time of day, the past is greyed out, the future is green and the present hour is in red.
Each text area also has a save button that will save that text area's text to local storage so that the page can be closed or refreshed without losing the information.
